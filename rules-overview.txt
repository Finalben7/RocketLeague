1. Overview- The goal of Amatuer Gamer Series is to provide a new fair, fun and competetive season oriented format to the Rocket Leauge community. We do this by
using the time tested, and proven, best of five series and the round robin bracket. Because these are our goals we want to warn you up front that alternate
accounts, smurfs ect... will not be tolerated. 

Once you create an account and form a team you are ready to join your placement league queue! Once the queue is filled with 8/8 teams the league will auto generate
and you will have seven weeks to play the seven other teams in your division. There is a recommended order but you are free to play any team, any time! Each season
match is a best of 5 and once all 49 matches are complete, a playoff bracket will generate. The top 6 teams, after tie-breakers, will compete in a single elimination
playoff bracket to determine the champion. The champion is automatically moved up one division, to not only reward them but to give them a chance to prove themselves 
at a higher level. Additionally, if the team that ends in last place records no series wins over the course of the season they will be moved down one division in 
hopes to find a more competetive league for them.
